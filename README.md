# scrambler

A quick and easy Rubiks cube scramble generator, inspired by u/N4Cubing [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cubers/comments/r6wclj/i_just_made_my_own_rubiks_cube_scrambler_in_java_d/)

Features:

- Choose your own scramble length
- No repeating moves
- 1/3 chance for double/inverse/normal moves

Still working on redundant move cancellation, see the [issues](https://github.com/jason-galea/scrambler/issues) page for more detail.
